# Mac Mini Home Server

The repository contains the configuration files for a lightweight NixOS server
with no graphical environment, for a early 2010s Mac Mini. It contains the necessary drivers
for WiFi support and listens for SSH connections automatically, and has server necessities like
docker.

The default interactive shell is `fish` and `nvim` with no configuration files is the default editor.
